# Project Outline

For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I will create a website for St. Charles MMA, a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Mixed Martial Arts gym. The main goal from the user standpoint is to provide easily accessible information about the gym through an engaging interface that will build excitement about the business. Secondary goals include adding online purchasing capability that is easy and useful to navigate and use, as well as online form download and submission capability.

From an administrator standpoint, the main goal is to provide a password-protected interface that will allow the owner to manage website content in order to keep information up to date. A secondary goal would be to manage waivers and other forms through the website with docusign.

I'm creating this website because the gym's current website needs an update. It's very static and often out of date. The additional features listed are things that the owner has expressed that he would like to have.

### Features

Admin CRUD interface: The site owner will be able to view, create, update, and delete various website content through a protected interface.
Administrator login: This is how the site owner will access the interface to create, update, and delete website content.
Interactive Event Calendar: This calendar will display both regular and special events, and can be expanded to show more information about an event.
File Download: There will be a page on the site which will allow users to download and/or sign and submit the gym waiver. I plan to use docusign for this, as well as simple file download capability.
Shopping Cart: Standard shopping cart.

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn

If the website is to have full ecommerce capablity, I'll have to learn how to accept payment securely online. I've used payment/shopping cart platforms in the past, but I would like to explore other options.
